The main goal of this project is to use UiPath to automate the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) procedure for
the NWU Tech Trends Telemetry Portal. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a crucial stage in the software development
lifecycle when users verify that the generated solution satisfies their needs. UAT is usually done manually, meaning 
that testers must enter data into the system and confirm the results. However, when working with huge datasets, this manual 
approach can be laborious and prone to human mistake.The project uses UiPath's Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate 
the UAT in order to streamline this procedure. The web application bot will receive data from an Excel file, enter it into 
the forms, submit it, and then verify that the record was properly generated by examining the outputÂ  .The bot will also 
update the Excel file with the results of the test, indicating whether each test case passed or failed.


How to Use the First Setup of the UiPath Bot:
Make sure UiPath Studio Community Edition has been downloaded and installed.
After downloading the Excel file with the test data, save it to a convenient location on your computer.
To host the UiPath project locally, clone the GitHub repository to your computer.

Launching the Bot for UiPath:
Load the NWU Tech Trends Telemetry Portal - User Acceptance Testing project into UiPath Studio.
Verify that the UiPath workflow's Excel file path is set up correctly. The input data is contained in this file,
which will be utilized to update the test findings.
Check the accessibility of the NWU Tech Trends Telemetry Portal online application.

Managing the Bot:

Let UiPath do its thing. The automated system will
Read the test data into a DataTable by opening the Excel file.
Every entry in the DataTable's records:
Go to the URL of the online application to enter data.
Fill in the relevant fields on the web application with the fields from the DataTable.
In order to add a new record, submit the form.
Go to the URL that allows you to view the newly created record and confirm that it is there.
To indicate if each entry passed or failed the test, update the Excel spreadsheet.
